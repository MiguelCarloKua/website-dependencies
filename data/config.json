Treat each chunk as potentially incomplete, but still summarize and extract all relevant facts available in the provided text.\nThen, rephrase these facts using neutral and objective legal language, avoiding interpretations or subjective phrasing.\nOutput should be a bullet-point list, with each bullet summarizing one factual detail. Do not use Markdown tables or formatting, and avoid any prefatory sentences."
